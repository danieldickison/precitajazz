title:  "Hello from Precita Park!"
---

Welcome to the newly launched internet website for the Precita Park Jazz Collective.

This group started as a casual jam in Precita Park in San Francisco, and has grown into a community of musicians who love to play together. We are often in the park on Sundays from noon until about 3pm. If you're in the area, come by and say hello! And please [contact us](/contact) if you're interested in having us play at your event.
